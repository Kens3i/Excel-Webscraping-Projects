# Project Portfolio

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.


## Projects

**[E-Commerce Dashboard with Tableau](https://github.com/Kens3i/TableauEcommerceDataAnalysis)**
<br>
![](https://github.com/Kens3i/TableauEcommerceDataAnalysis/blob/main/Images/Tableau%20Dashboard.png?raw=true)
<br>
Analyzed an e-commerce database where there has **approx. 5000 columns** using **Tableau Public**. The data is about a website named "GoShopping" and the data contains the information about the incoming traffic by the different users. **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.

Selenium is an extremely powerful tool used for  web data scraping however, it has some flaws that is fair because it was produced mainly to test web applications. On the other hand, BeautifulSoup was developed produced for data scraping and it is extremely powerful indeed. However, even BeautifulSoup has its faults, it won’t be beneficial if the required data is behind the “wall”, as it needs user’s login for accessing the data or needs some actions from users. That’s where we can utilize Selenium, for automating user interactions through the website as well as we would use BeautifulSoup for scraping data.

I would be using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract product information like name, ratings, etc. from https://www.amazon.in/.

**[Interactive Fashion Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/Kens3i/ExcelSalesDashboard)**
<br>
![](https://github.com/Kens3i/ExcelSalesDashboard/blob/main/Display%20Gif.gif?raw=true)
<br>
Developed and designed an **interactive sales dashboard** by using data which has **72000+ columns and 11 Rows** using **MS Excel 2016**. The data is about 2 fashion stores named “Fashion Direct” and “Next Look” based in Australia. The data spans from January 2016 to July 2017. **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.

**[The Stock Prediction App](https://github.com/Kens3i/The-Stock-Prediction-App)**
<br>

<br>

This app lets you generate a live time-series forecast of FAAMG stocks, predict the short term and long term future prices of them (up to 7 years), lets you convert the currency as per your needs, and also lets you convert currency from as per the user likes.

**[Indeed Job Scrapper](https://github.com/Kens3i/Indeed-Multipage-Job-Scrapper)**
<br>

<br>
"Indeed" is one of the most popular job websites in the market today. Scraping "Indeed" job data can help us access the latest job data, analyze job trends, and automate job boards. "Indeed" allows us to search job-based on location and keywords. I will be using job title and job location along with the number of pages of search results to crawl "Indeed" and extract the data.

**[Dynamic Tech Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/Kens3i/DynamicTechSalesDashboard)**
<br>
![](https://github.com/Kens3i/DynamicTechSalesDashboard/blob/main/display%20gif.gif?raw=true)
<br>
This is a **dynamic interactive dashbord** which shows the sales data of a hypothetical company, Nord Tech. I developed this dashboard with the help of **MS Excel 2016** and incorporated **pivot tables**, **filters** and **timeline boxes**. Nord Tech basically sells electronic applications like printer, mouse, keyboard, etc and it has salesmen throughout different regions i.e North, South, East, West.  **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.

**[IMDB Scrapper](https://github.com/Kens3i/IMDB-Scrapper-Using-Selenium-and-Beautiful-Soup)**
<br>

<br>
This program has 2 parts. The first part is a automation bot made with the help of Selenium which opens a Google Chrome tab and navigates to the IMDB home page. Then it goes to the advanced search and selects different parameters to filter some movies. Then in the 2nd part I developed a web-scrapper which scraps the data of those movies like the title, the year in which it got released, the rating of the movie, etc.

**[Advance House Price Predictor](https://github.com/Kens3i/Data-Science-And-ML-Projects/tree/main/Advance%20House%20Price%20Predictor)**
<br>
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/5407/media/housesbanner.png)
<br>
There are several factors that influence the price a buyer is willing to pay for a house. Some are apparent and obvious and some are not. Nevertheless, a rational approach facilitated by machine learning can be very useful in predicting the house price. A large data set with 79 different features (like living area, number of rooms, location etc) along with their prices are provided for residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The challenge is to learn a relationship between the important features and the price and use it to predict the prices of a new set of houses.
Applied **EDA**, **Data Preprocessing** , **Feature Engineering** and finally a **50/50 blend of XGB and LGBM** regression model to achieve suitable predictions.

**[Invisibility Cloak](https://github.com/Kens3i/Data-Science-And-ML-Projects/tree/main/Invisibility%20Cloak%20With%20OpenCV)**
<br>
[![](https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640_invisibility-cloak.jpg)]()
<br>

This is simply a program that uses **image segmentation** and **image processing** to replace the foreground object of interest with the background. Only the **`red` color** will get **invisible** and we will be seeing the background instead of any red object. We are capturing the **live feed** of the person and breaking that feed into images, basically frames. On those frames we will apply **image segmentation** to differentiate the color of the object from rest of the image and we then super-impose the background image over there.  
**Basically this [app](https://github.com/Kens3i/Data-Science-And-ML-Projects/blob/main/Invisibility%20Cloak%20With%20OpenCV) turns a `red` colour cloth into an invisibility cloak**.
