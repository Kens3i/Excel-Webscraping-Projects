## Data-Viz-Projects

**[Interactive Fashion Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/Kens3i/ExcelSalesDashboard)**
<br>
![](https://github.com/Kens3i/ExcelSalesDashboard/blob/main/Display%20Gif.gif?raw=true)
<br>
Developed and designed an **interactive sales dashboard** by using data which has **72000+ columns and 11 Rows** using **MS Excel 2016**. The data is about 2 fashion stores named “Fashion Direct” and “Next Look” based in Australia. The data spans from January 2016 to July 2017. **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.

<br>

<br>
This is a **dynamic interactive dashbord** which shows the sales data of a hypothetical company, Nord Tech. I developed this dashboard with the help of **MS Excel 2016** and incorporated **pivot tables**, **filters** and **timeline boxes**. Nord Tech basically sells electronic applications like printer, mouse, keyboard, etc and it has salesmen throughout different regions i.e North, South, East, West.  **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.

Selenium is an extremely powerful tool used for  web data scraping however, it has some flaws that is fair because it was produced mainly to test web applications. On the other hand, BeautifulSoup was developed produced for data scraping and it is extremely powerful indeed. However, even BeautifulSoup has its faults, it won’t be beneficial if the required data is behind the “wall”, as it needs user’s login for accessing the data or needs some actions from users. That’s where we can utilize Selenium, for automating user interactions through the website as well as we would use BeautifulSoup for scraping data.

I would be using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract product information like name, ratings, etc. from https://www.amazon.in/.

<br>
"Indeed" is one of the most popular job websites in the market today. Scraping "Indeed" job data can help us access the latest job data, analyze job trends, and automate job boards. "Indeed" allows us to search job-based on location and keywords. I will be using job title and job location along with the number of pages of search results to crawl "Indeed" and extract the data.

**[IMDB Scrapper](https://github.com/Kens3i/IMDB-Scrapper-Using-Selenium-and-Beautiful-Soup)**

<br>
This program has 2 parts. The first part is a automation bot made with the help of Selenium which opens a Google Chrome tab and navigates to the IMDB home page. Then it goes to the advanced search and selects different parameters to filter some movies. Then in the 2nd part I developed a web-scrapper which scraps the data of those movies like the title, the year in which it got released, the rating of the movie, etc.
